Background
-----------
The cookie banner requires the user to click a green tick to accept the tag type (GTM allowlist ID). This can be missed and cause difficulty for the user.

Also, the user may not be aware that the GTM Allowlist ID field is empty.

Solution
-----------
The GTM allowlist ID is now validated and accepted at the point of saving the cookie banner settings.
