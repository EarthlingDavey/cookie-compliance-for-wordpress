Further testing of the application uncovered an error where a value was trying to be assigned to the `allowlist` var
in `global.js` (line 181) even when it was equal to null. This occurred on sections that do not contain an ID input field.

This release fixes and satisfies the following bug:

-  global.js?2d9b:181 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'val' of null
